## each cluster is saved into a numpy 2D array which includes the clustering parameters and the name of the sdss object. To get the other parameters for the same object that were not used in the clustering, I can cross match the cluster 2D array with the full subsample array ss (defined in line 14 here).



## each cluster is represented by a composite spectrum with the number of objects in each cluster given in the FITS header (keyword:'SPEC_NUMBER')
